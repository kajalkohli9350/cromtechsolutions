          modules in the solution are as given below:
        </p>
        <p>patient</p>
        <p>Ward Management</p>

          Technically speaking, the System has been developed to support
          Platform Independence thus is not binding the client to a specific
          hardware infrastructure. Additional terminals may be attached as
          easily as it is to add the system to the network because being web
          based no extra computer specific overhead is required. The System
          operates on a 3 tier architecture hence all the clients are thin
          clients with each and every database operation being handled by the
          backend web server that in turns communicates with the Database Server
          to perform the operation.
